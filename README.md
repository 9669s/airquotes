This was my first AngularJS project and yet it's surprisingly not that bad. It is an automatic quote generator for a t-shirt website which I developed for someone with whom I used to work. At the time of writing this it was not yet deployed because some of the PHP it has to hook to on the server side was less than stable. But all of the client side work I did was working like a champ.

It's a good example of an AngularJS application that's not completely trivial and yet one that does not depend upon having a service it has to connect to for getting and persisting data.

Note: I asked for and received permission to distribute the source code for this project before agreeing to do it. It was understood that I would be sharing the code and writing about it.
